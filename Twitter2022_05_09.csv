The question is often posed: How will emergency vehicles get to where they’re going?

As an EMT, I have several points to make regarding this.

I spent my day responding to news of NYers killed walking and biking - 6 people in 3 days. Then, as I left home to pick up my kids, an ambulance stood at the corner carting away another injured cyclist. Why are we forced to fight so hard to not be killed traveling around NYC?",,,
