The question is often posed: How will emergency vehicles get to where they’re going?

As an EMT, I have several points to make regarding this.

This is the list of violations from the driver- Michael de Guzman- who killed Raife Milligan. Four school speeding zone violations in the last 6 months, 29 total violations in 7 months. NYC needs to do a better job keeping drivers with clear disregard for the city off the roads.

paco (dave) abraham,@subtle116,2022-05-06T00:55:12.000Z,Fully agree. Also want to point out that a bike lane could have easily been protected there and along the curb but every car pictured in those images is illegally parking. Addressing placard abuse should should be part of the changes to keep tragedies like this from occurring.,,1,8

I spent my day responding to news of NYers killed walking and biking - 6 people in 3 days. Then, as I left home to pick up my kids, an ambulance stood at the corner carting away another injured cyclist. Why are we forced to fight so hard to not be killed traveling around NYC?",,,
