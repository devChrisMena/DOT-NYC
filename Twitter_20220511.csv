Nycallday,@Nycallday5,2022-05-11T08:27:19.000Z,Where can I see a study you did proving this ? Speed cameras make the city money and that’s all you care about.  Saying something and seeing something are two different things.,,,

Look how lucky we are.

These horrible stoops are being installed on the OS by the end of May. The article says that the two were made for $55,000. That is a lot of $$$ for this ""item"" - hunk of metal.

We need an audit of the DOT and their partner.
