## Overview

### Description

Create an application that captures customer sentiment automatically and efficiently, reducing the resources needed for this task. Automatically fetch text from DOTâ€™s Twitter and Instagram and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, and neutral) of the text using NLP techniques.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social Networking / Neural Network / Language
- **Compatibility:** This app is primarily developed for Windows devices, and its functionality may be limited to such devices.
- **Story:** Automate feedback gathering from a social group. Users can execute scripts to obtain information from their specific followers, gather statistical data to understand sentiment, and classify sentences as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Market:** Targeted at the social media team at the NYC DOT.

## Usage

Provide login information for Twitter or Instagram, then run one of the scripts to fetch data for the target account.

| Property  | Type   | Description                  |
|-----------|--------|------------------------------|
| name      | String | User's displayed name        |
| username  | String | Unique username for the user |
| timestamp | String | Time when posted             |
| comment   | String | Text containing user's response |

### Instagram

## Manual

### 1. GUI

The **GUI** is designed for simple use. All functional parameters are preset and ready to run. The GUI has the following components:

- Text Input: Accepts a number representing days. It calculates a date range consisting of the current date minus the given number of days.
- Twitter Button: Runs the Twitter script to fetch data.
- Instagram Button: Runs the Instagram script to fetch data.
- Analyze Twitter: Runs the script model to evaluate a CSV file corresponding to the data fetched from the Twitter script.
- Analyze Instagram: Runs the script model to evaluate a CSV file corresponding to the data fetched from the Instagram script.

### 2. Scripts

The **Twitter** script takes four parameters:

- Login Account Name: Name of the dummy account to use.
- Login Account Password: Password for the dummy account.
- Target Account: Account or hashtag to search.
- Range Date: Given a number of days, fetch data within the current date and the current date minus the given number of days.

The **Instagram** script also takes four parameters:

- Login Account Name: Name of the dummy account to use.
- Login Account Password: Password for the dummy account.
- Target Account: Account or hashtag to search.
- Range Date: Given a number of days, fetch data within the current date and the current date minus the given number of days.

### 3. Outputs

Each script outputs two **CSV** files corresponding to the platform from which data was fetched.

- One **CSV** file contains the data fetched from the social media platform, including:
  - Username
  - User's name (optional, for Twitter)
  - Timestamp
  - Comment
- The second **CSV** file contains data processed by the Deep Learning Model, including:
  - Comment fetched
  - Rating for comment
- Optionally, the user can decide whether to save infographics such as bar plots or pie charts when running the scripts.

### 4. Installation

To properly use the software, follow these steps. Note that the program is cross-compatible with all major operating systems, but the installation process is specific to Windows devices:

1. Download and install Python from the official website [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), selecting the latest version available.

2. Download and install the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) web browser. If already installed, update it to the latest version by clicking the three dots in the top-right corner, going to the **Help** section, clicking **About Google Chrome**, and selecting the update option.

3. Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

4. Download the Webdriver for Chrome, which corresponds to your Chrome version, from [Chrome Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and save it in a separate directory.

5. Add the Webdriver directory to the **System Variables**:
   - Search for **Edit System Variable** on Windows.
   - Click on **Environment Variables**.
   - Select **Path** under **System variables** and click **Edit**.
   - Add the directory where the **Webdriver** is located to the system PATH.

6. Download the software package:
   - Clone the repo or download package files by clicking **Code** then **Download ZIP**.

7. Set up packages:
   - Open **Visual Studio Code**, open the project directory within it.
   - Run `Setup.py` to install necessary packages.
   - Run `Download.py` to download supplementary files needed to run the software. If `Download.py` fails, try switching the Python interpreter or closing and reopening VS Code.

Here's a GIF showing how to add the Webdriver directory to the system PATH:
