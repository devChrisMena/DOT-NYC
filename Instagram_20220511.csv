desmojohnny,What a joke. How do you even have this job? Most likely because you can barely speak english.,2022-05-10T15:33:23.000Z
nodrog321,There are way too many times where the car in front of me slammed on the brakes just because they saw a speed camera. They don’t work for the intended purpose. Only thing it does is give the city money that doesn’t go back to us.,2022-05-10T15:33:23.000Z
jpwallz,"The reality is the only way to prevent drivers killing pedestrians and cyclists is to keep them separate at this point. The city needs to lean hard into barricade protected bike lanes, and expand open streets aggressively with pedestrian only thoroughfares across the city.",2022-05-10T15:33:23.000Z

trebor132,"Good social studies teacher terrible at transportation commissioner. Plus from which year is the statistics that he is getting, we are just open up from a 2 year lock down pandemic it wasn't that much traffic going on. Decreasing neighborhood parking with the city bikes station make it hard to find parking for the hard worker family. Plus the repairs of the avenues and street of New York city work that can be done in weeks taking years to be done just to overtime that contract with contractors that are friends with the system.",2022-05-10T15:33:23.000Z

highlife_tali,"@nyc_dot lets cut the crap. This is nothing but a financial gain, this wont stop or prevent anything. Thats why Albany would not allow it, look at the profit NYC is making off just 1 camera. You guys are greedy and money hungry.",2022-05-10T15:33:23.000Z

jooltman,The bike lane you show does not provide a 3 foot buffer if a person on bike avoids riding in door zone. We need buffers and hard protection from cars. Deliver this or stop talking.,2022-05-06T20:57:48.000Z

ottodirty30,"People need a more reliable way to get around for them to abandon their cars. This is a city with 10M people, it’s never as simple as throwing 900M on a problem and thinking it will get fixed. City planning is def not what it used to be, big props to the designers from early 1900’s but that’s about it. Most of that money is going to end up in engineering firms pockets…need to look 20-40 years ahead…and start now! Every politician wants a program so they can slap their name on it…and say things like look at what I did…this is so frustrating and I don’t see a solution any time soon…I’m done ranting good luck to everyone out there and stay safe…",2022-05-03T20:03:09.000Z

bkmidnight,"How about focusing on people & bicyclists who don't adhere 2 traffic laws. People busy on face time or making videos while crossing, or the people who run out in traffic as the light changes. The bicyclists who ignore traffic lights & speed to pass the light as it changes? Or go through the red lights & have hit walking pedestrians. They don't even use the bike lanes & prefer to Bob in & out of cars & people.",2022-05-02T19:36:36.000Z
